# 🤖 Working RAG QA BusinessBot

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question Answering bot tailored for business-related queries using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 📌 Project Overview

- Combines document retrieval with LLM-based generation to answer domain-specific questions.
- Ideal for business use cases like FAQs, internal policy browsing, or knowledge base automation.
- Built using Python, LangChain, and HuggingFace Transformers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- LangChain  
- HuggingFace Transformers  
- FAISS / ChromaDB  
- Streamlit *(optional frontend)*
